This version of `note.pug` is a single html page that fetches all the raw markdown github data on page load.

It is an alternative to templating out a ton of htmls files

PROS

- Saves space in project and Github pages (1GB limit)

CONS

- No customizable SSO/discorverability
- Redundant. All the .md files already live on Github.
